# Directives
## What are directives?
Directives are "enhancements" for elements (built-in ones or components)
- "enhance"means that extra behaviors or setting can be added to those elements.
- directives have no template.
- in the other words: components are directives with a template.
## ngModel
- allowing us to perform two-way binding, also seems to be responsible for adding these classes.
## ngIf
